(really, just go see the manual on this)
assign the info to the range by refernce

after binding the pipeline, before the draw pass, translate() the model
after that, call vkcommandpushconstants() or do something like 

commandbuffer.pushConstants(pipelinelayout, shaderstageflags, offset,sizeof(mariodata), objectdata)
