-they dont require memory to be set aside for them, because they use memory alredy set aside for vulkan
-they are declared alongside the other crap you do in vkpipelinecreateinfo as pushconstantranges
-pushconstantrange is a pointer to an array of push constant ranges 
-one per pipeline
-garunteed to be 128 kb 

so three(ish) parts:
declare in pipeline
consume in the shader
update with vkcmdpushconstants
